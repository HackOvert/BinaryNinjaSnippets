# Binary Ninja Snippets
*Binary Ninja Snippets* is a collection of Python examples showing how to work with [Binary Ninja][0]'s Python API. Many of the examples here focus on using the Binary Ninja Intermediate Language (BNIL) suite which includes LLIL, MLIL, HLIL along with [SSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form) versions of each.

## Loading and Working with Binary Targets
In this section we'll cover common methods for loading binary targets and getting information about the target.

### Loading a binary
Binary Ninja uses a [BinaryView](https://api.binary.ninja/binaryninja.binaryview-module.html) is one of the most important objects in Binary Ninja. If you need to work on any component of a target, you'll be doing it through a BinaryView (BV for short).  Let's see a basic way to getting a BV.

```python
# Method 1
with binaryninja.open_view("/bin/true") as bv:
    print(type(bv))

# Method 2: Using this method, you must close the binary view yourself when done with it
bv = binaryninja.BinaryViewType.get_view_of_file_with_options("/bin/true")
print(type(bv))
bv.file.close()
```

### Getting basic information from a BinaryView
Let's grab some simple information from a BV and display it to the user. I often use `print(dir(bv))` to remind myself what attributes and methods are available on a BinaryView. You can get much more detailed information from the [BinaryView docs](https://api.binary.ninja/binaryninja.binaryview.BinaryView.html).

```python
with binaryninja.open_view("/bin/true") as bv:
    print("Binary name:     {}".format(bv.file.filename))
    print("Number of funcs: {}".format(len(bv.functions)))
    print("Endianness:      {}".format(bv.endianness.name))
    print("Entry function:  {}".format(bv.entry_function))
    print("Entry point:     0x{:08X}".format(bv.entry_point))
    print("Executable:      {}".format(bv.executable))
    print("Address size:    {}".format(bv.address_size))
    print("Arch:            {}".format(bv.arch))
```
